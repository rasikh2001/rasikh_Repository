I’m a student focused on web development, building a "Lost & Found Community" app with C# ASP.NET. It includes features for posting items, chatting, and secure logins. I enjoy clear explanations and hands-on learning, and I’m developing skills in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and ASP.NET Identity, along with SignalR for real-time updates. I’m also creating a lab manual on LAN cable connections and studying evaluation techniques for my assignments.
